# Refactoring: Web Scraper

I was asked by someone to code review a web scraper. I performed the
refactoring as a series of git commits with (hopefully) helpful commit
messages.

The goal was to make the code more idiomatic python.

I attempted to make minimal changes to the initial app to make it more
testable, then tested it to guide further refactorings. Were I truly dogmatic,
I would have written the stdout stubbing test (the hardest one to write of the
suite, by far) first.

If you have questions about changes I made, feel free to open an issue.
